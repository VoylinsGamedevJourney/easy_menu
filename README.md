# EasyMenu

A simple application to make compiling/building software easier for your users or yourself.

## How does it work?

Take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/VoylinsGamedevJourney/easy_menu/tree/master/examples) which will show how this application works. Basically it looks for a file called easy_menu.conf and uses the data in that file to build a menu. In this menu you can let the user adjust settings and press buttons to do actions. That's it, it's that simple.

## Why does this exist?

Two reason for why this exists, first of all for me personally. When building [GDE GoZen](https://github.com/VoylinsGamedevJourney/gde_gozen) I use a lot of commands and even though I have a python script to help me select options, I wanted a small UI menu that I can keep floating over my NeoVim to more easily compile after I made changes to my code and when opening the menu that it would fill out my previously used compile/build settings.

Reason number two is because some people can not even run a simple python script without running into issues. So I hope that with this UI window, compiling will become easier for people and it's something I'll start using in all programs I make.

## Support me

Of course I need to put a shameless plug to my Ko-fi page because ... I'd like to be able to pay the bills :p
